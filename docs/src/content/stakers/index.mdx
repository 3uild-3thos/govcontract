# For Stakers

Commands available to delegators (stakers) for overriding validator votes.

## Available Commands

- **[Cast Vote Override](/stakers/cast-vote-override)** - Override a validator's vote as a delegator
- **[Modify Vote Override](/stakers/modify-vote-override)** - Modify an existing vote override

## Overview

Delegators can override their validator's vote on governance proposals using stake account verification. This allows delegators to express their own voting preferences independently of their validator.

## Requirements

- Stake account owned by the delegator
- Stake account must be delegated to a validator
- Active stake in the account
- Access to operator API for snapshot data (or use default)

## How Vote Overrides Work

When a delegator casts a vote override:
1. The CLI fetches snapshot data from the operator API
2. Verifies the delegator owns the stake account
3. Submits the override vote to the governance program
4. The override vote takes precedence over the validator's vote for that specific stake account

## Global Arguments

All commands support these global arguments:

- `--identity-keypair <PATH>` (or `-i`) - Path to identity keypair JSON file
- `--rpc-url <URL>` (or `-r`) - Custom RPC URL

These can also be set via environment variables `SVMGOV_KEY` and `SVMGOV_RPC`.
